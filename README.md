### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
As an enthusiastic and curious explorer, I've learnt many skills and diversified my knowledge into various fields. At present, I am undergraduate student of Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science learning and implementing various languages and technologies including front-end, back-end, Python, C++ and AI. <br>
Actively seeking internship opportunities and curious to collaborate.<br>
I like to learn about Figma, Canva and Adobe Photoshop. I was Graphic Designer Lead in Meta Developer Circle, MIT (during my sophomore year). This gave me a magnificent opportunity to work in cooperation with other colleagues on various projects. <br>
Apart from this, I explored stock marketing and psychology. In free time, I be fond of novels and informative books.
I like to work in an organized and schematic way.<br>
If you're seeking for a versatile tech-enthusiast with management skills and interests on various topics, let's make a passionate team.<br>
Your help and guidance are always appreciated. Let's achieve and explore together!
