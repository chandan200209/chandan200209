### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
As an enthusiastic and curious explorer, I have learnt many skills and diversified my knowledge into various fields. At present, I am undergraduate student of Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science learning web frameworks and technologies including AI.
I am Graphic Designer Lead in Meta Developer Circle, MIT. This gave me a magnificent opportunity to work in cooperation with other colleagues on various projects. I like to learn about Figma, Canva and Adobe Photoshop.
Apart from this, I learnt about stock marketing and psychology. In free time, I be fond of novels and informative books.
I like to work in an organized and schematic way.
If you're seeking for a versatile tech-enthusiast with management skills and interests on various topics, let's make a passionate team.
Your help and guidance are always appreciated.
