<center><strong><h3>Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm CHANDAN RAMTEKE</h3></strong></center>
<br>

As an enthusiastic and curious explorer, I've learned many skills and diversified my knowledge in various fields. I am an undergraduate student of Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science learning and implementing various languages and technologies including front-end, back-end, Python, C++, and AI. <br>
Actively seeking internship opportunities and curious to collaborate.<br>
I like to learn about Figma, Canva, and Adobe Photoshop. I was Graphic Designer Lead in Meta Developer Circle, MIT (during my sophomore year). This gave me a magnificent opportunity to work in cooperation with other colleagues on various projects. <br>
Apart from this, I explored stock marketing and psychology. I will be fond of novels and informative books in my free time.
I like to work in an organized and schematic way.<br>
If you're seeking a versatile tech enthusiast with management skills and interests in various topics, let's make a passionate team.<br>
I would appreciate your help and guidance. Let's achieve and explore together!
